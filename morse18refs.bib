abstract="The use of robots is gaining considerable traction in several domains, since they are capable of assisting and replacing humans for everyday tasks. To harvest the full potential of robots, it must be possible to define missions for robots that are domain-specific, resilient, and collaborative. Currently, robot vendors provide low-level APIs to program such missions, making mission definition a task-specific and error-prone activity. There is a need for quick definition of new missions, by users that lack programming expertise, such as farmers and emergency workers. In this paper, we extend the existing FLYAQ platform to support the high-level specification of adaptive and highly-resilient missions. We present an extensible specification language that allows users to declaratively specify domain-specific constraints as properties of missions, thus complementing the existing FLYAQ mission language. This permits to move at runtime, the actual generation of low-level operations to satisfy the declaratively specified mission. We show how this specification language can be automatically generated from a domain-specific FLYAQ mission language by using the generative ProMoBox approach. Next, we show how mission goals are achieved taking mission properties into account, and how missions may change due to unexpected circumstances.",

abstract="A large number of robotic software have been developed but cannot or can hardly interoperate with each other because of their dependencies on specific hardware or software platform is hard-wired into the code. Consequently, robotic software is hard and expensive to develop because there is little opportunity of reuse and because low-level details must be taken into account in early phases. Moreover, robotic experts can hardly develop their application without programming knowledge or the help of programming experts and robotic software is difficult to adapt to hardware or target-platform changes. In this paper we report on the development of RobotML, a Robotic Modeling Language that eases the design of robotic applications, their simulation and their deployment to multiple target execution platforms.",

abstract="Real-time software systems encountered in telecommunications, aerospace, and defense often tend to be very large and extremely complex. It is crucial in such systems that the software has a well-defined architecture. This not only facilitates construction of the initial system, it also simplifies system evolution. We describe a set of modeling constructs that facilitate the specification of complex software architectures for real-time systems. These constructs are derived from field-proven concepts originally defined in the ROOM modeling language. Furthermore, we show how they can be represented using the industry-standard Unified Modeling Language (UML) by using the powerful extensibility mechanisms of UML.",
